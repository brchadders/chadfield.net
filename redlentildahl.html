<h1>Red Lentil Dahl (V)</h1>
<br>
<h3><span style="font-weight: normal;">Prep: 20 mins
// Cooking time: 40 minutes</span><br>
</h3>
<h3>Ingredients list:</h3>
4 tbsp salted butter (<span style="font-style: italic;">use
plant-based alternative to make this whole dish vegan</span>)<br>
1 large onion, finely chopped<br>
6 cloves of garlic, crushed<br>
1 to 2 inches of root ginger<br>
1 tbsp of medium curry powder<br>
1 tsp of cayenne pepper (<span style="font-style: italic;">remove
if you want mild)</span><br>
720ml water<br>
1 can of coconut milk<br>
2 tbsp of tomato puree/paste<br>
1 can of plum tomatoes<br>
400ml of dried red lentils<br>
juice of half a fresh lemon (<span style="font-style: italic;">or
a tsp of lemon concentrate</span>)<br>
1 tsp garam masala<br>
<h3>Cooking instructions</h3>
1. Heat half of the butter in a large Dutch pot (steel, or enamelled
iron) set over a medium heat. Add onions until they are softened and
transluscent. Add garlic and grated ginger, stirring often to make sure
garlic is cooked and not burned.<br>
2. Stir in the curry powder and cayenne and keep stirring as it cooks
and becomes more fragrant. Longer than a minute and you'll burn the
spices.<br>
3. Add the tomatoes first, and with your wooden spoon/spatula crush the
plum tomatoes before adding water, coconut milk, tomato paste.<br>
4. Stir in the lentils and bring to the boil.<br>
5. Reduce heat and allow to simmer for approx 30 minutes.<br>
6. The lentils should be soft, so now is the time to add the lemon
juice and garam masala before allowing to simmer for a further 10
minutes.<br>
7. Serve with rice. Roasted aubergine with paprika works well as a side dish.<br>
