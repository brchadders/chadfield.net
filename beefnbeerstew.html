Traditional
Belgian beer stew, with tender beef in a thick beer gravy that's a
little sweet. Real Flemish pub grub, nearly always served with chips or
fries, but goes well with mash too.<br>
<h3>Ingredients list:</h3>
1kg of beef, cubed (Traditionally shin of beef is used, but any lean
cut with sinew and fat trimmed-off works well)<br>
2 tbsp plain flour, with pinch of salt and black pepper<br>
25g of (proper) butter<br>
2 tbsp cooking oil of your choice<br>
500g of shallots (or brown onions), roughly chopped <br>
1 sprig of fresh thyme<br>
3 bay leaves (because why not)<br>
2
small bottles (33cl) of Belgian beer (I've tried various, my favourite
being St Stefanus Blonde, but others work and bring a different
flavour, including Duvel, Leffe and darker brown Belgian beers.)<br>
250ml of beef stock<br>
2 heaped tbsp (scoops) of redcurrant jelly<br>
1 tbsp cider vinegar<br>
<h3>Cooking instructions</h3>
1. Pre-heat oven to 180C<br>
2. Dredge the beef in seasoned flour, mix to coat the meat<br>
3. Heat butter and oil in large non-stick Dutch/enamelled Iron pot
(Orange colour not essential)<br>
4. Add the beef to the pot and brown on all sides<br>
5. Remove the beef and set to one side<br>
6. In the same pan, cook the onions or shallots until browned, then 7.
return the beef to the pan.<br>
8. Add the herbs, beer and stock to the pan, scraping up the browned
bits from the bottom.<br>
9. Add the redcurrant jelly and stir well<br>
10. Put the lid on the pot, and place in the oven to cook for 2 hours,
or until meat is tender.<br>
11. Serve with chips (or root vegetables and mash, just don't tell the
Belgians)<br>
